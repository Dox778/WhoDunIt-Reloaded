wdi02:all the systems of security camera  are fixed
grafics in soft and geometry.

wdi05: apparently some of the ladders of the map 
could enable anyone to perform an exploit where 
someone could fly around the map and screw up 
with everyone, the map has a bunch of anti-fly 
scripts rounded about to prevent that, also some 
areas had HOMs on software mode, we removed a 
small exploit on the blue murdhole just under the 
m1 carbine spawn that enabled people to grab a 
bertholite canister or some tripwire shotguns 
(other times known as the berth-grab exploit)

wdi08: there were some murderer holes that did 
not have a monster block lines to prevent 
innocents from going inside the murdholes, also 
some textures on some walls/floors were wrong 
and thus the right textures were added to them

wdi09: the map was a massive lagfest and some 
3dfloor areas were damaging sectors, also some 
murdholes could be opened and accessed by 
innocents as well as some locker areas with guns,
those were fixed, also there was apparently a 
bug with the ladders that made anyone that was 
on a ladder when the game ended have 30 
gravity on the next map (and maybe forever if 
he din't die/get forcespectated.).
fixed elevator the  ppl can jam the elevator under

wdi13: massive lag reduced 'nuff said 
(also removed the white fog on the map, 
because lolcantsee)

wdi14: nothing was fixed, map by prepper, 
actually some areas were prettied up but eh
wdi15: HOMs on some areas, also prepper made a 
skybox, as to not make the open area on the 
left area of the map look ugly and boring

wdi16: nothing was changed but a small 3d floor 
near the lava caverns as to make it easier for 
people to cross from one side to the other 
without having to waste 10 minutes going back 
and forth from the waterfall to the beach.
*Fixed "player count"when begins the ppl go into the cliff
and die this create a glitch with the number of players 
*fixed if the ppl jump into the cliff, they can survive

wdi17: some homs, missing 3d floors 
(they did not appear in software mode cuz they 
were sloped 3dfloors) yadda yadda all murdholes 
din't have monster block lines etc. etc.

wdi18: cooperation with abbuw as to not leave 
his first wdi map to be ultimately a cramped 
shithole of cockblocking and berthspamming, 
also some areas got better details 'n stuff

hi i'm roman6a here, and this is all that was 
changed from the maps, have a good night 
(or evening, whatever suits you fine gentlemen.)
