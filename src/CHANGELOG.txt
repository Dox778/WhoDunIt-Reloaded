=============== GAMEPLAY CHANGES:
+ weapons can now be thrown far away! Hold the 'drop weapon' key for a moment and you'll immediately throw your weapon far away.
+ added playing dead - you need to bind it in the menu. It also doesn't change your hitbox size. ALSO you need to hold your fists out.
+ added gas canister for refueling your chainsaw!
+ also, to accomodate the gas canister's introduction, the chainsaw has been tweaked:
you turn it on with the normal fire
altfire is now for reloading (if you have multiple cans on you and hold it down for long enough, you'll keep using them)
to turn it off, just deselect it
- Tweaked spray cans' damage and responsiveness when it comes to drawing.
- Made fire extinguisher spawn more frequently.
- Optimized and smoothed out dance controls.
- Added bouncy balls! They're there just to have fun and come with a lot of variation.
=============== VISUAL ETC:

So far only WDI16 and WDI14 have received that treatment.
