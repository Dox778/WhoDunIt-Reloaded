Welcome to <b>Who Dun It: Reloaded!</b> A fork of the original [Who Dun It](https://doomwiki.org/wiki/Who_Dun_It) mod, created by a team led by [Aric Carpenter (also known as Firewolf)](https://doomwiki.org/wiki/Aric_Carpenter_(Firewolf)).

# QUICK INTRODUCTION

<b>Who Dun It</b> is a multiplayer focused survival mod for Zandronum. Your objective depends on what team you're in: 
- if you're an innocent, stay alive, scout for useful items and sniff out the murderer. Work as a team to eliminate him.
- As a murderer, your objective is simple - <i>kill everyone</i>. You'll get an exclusive knife and stash of items to help you win against the overwhelming odds.

The mod has plenty of custom maps designed specifically for this gamemode, each with an unique theme and occasional gimmicks to keep the experience fresh and interesting.

## Now, what does Reloaded bring to the table?

<b>Who Dun It: Reloaded</b> can be considered an update to the original mod - that includes balance tweaks, new features, assets, general quality of life improvements.
It initially started as a small addon that only gave weapons new animation, but it eventually evolved into a big project that ups the quality standards for the whole mod.

Here's a taste of what the mod has to offer compared to the base mod:

### WEAPONS:
- Every weapon had been given new animations and/or sprites, as seen down in the videos section.
- Plenty of NEW weapons to keep the arsenal fresh. (Screw driver, fire extinguisher, revolver...)
- Exclusive weapons only for the murderer, aiding them greatly if they're lucky enough to pick one up!
- (almost) all of the missing weapon skins for the players have been added.
- Melee weapons can be stained with blood with enough use!
### P2P (player-to-player) INTERACTIONS:
- 2 new sound classes, to remove the repetetiveness of having only 2.
- Dances, a whopping 6 of them! there's even, uh, twerking... yeah...
- You can slap people and that pushes them a little bit, leading to funny situations lol
- Introducing: Playing dead! You can now pretend to be a corpse, and hopefully stay undetected.
- Players will now drop their items upon death. How it behaves is customizable!
- Players can now ping stuff! Useful if you want your mate to pay attention to a specific thing.
- You can customize OR randomize your player's width/height for everyone too see!
- Crouching eliminates footstep sounds, giving players a chance to be sneaky.
###  MAP RELATED STUFF:
- Integrated all the map expansions, as well as some maps ported over from [Who Dun It: MAX](https://zandronum.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=1726)
- BUMPMAPS. A good chunk of textures now reflect light, greatly aiding the visual aspect/uniqueness of the mod! (Completely optional, included as a separate file)
- It might struggle with specific hardware or operating systems...
- Brightmaps are also included - some textures will now glow in the dark, enhancing the atmosphere.
- Plenty of decorations are now interactive and have way more variation.
- Some can even give you nice drops when broken!
- plenty of ambient sounds sprinkled over the maps to enhance the atmosphere (clock sounds, wind blowing, crickets etc)
- Maps can occasionally start/stop being rainy. The rain's strength is also customizable! (Some maps are excluded from raining)
###  MISC:
- Unique loading screen and main menu! (thanks Kaminsky <33333)
- Dedicated menu for the mod's options.
- A lot of new sprites and added effects to existing features.
- A LOT of options for customized experience.

And that's not even all there is to mention!
