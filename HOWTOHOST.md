# HOW TO HOST WHO DUN IT: RELOADED

There are multiple methods for hosting the mod:

- External hosting service such as [Euroboros](https://euroboros.net) for EU or [The sentinel's Playground](https://allfearthesentinel.com) for USA.
  (There are more of these services available out there.)

- Host the mod on your own computer via Doomseeker with the help of this [tutorial](https://youtu.be/RldaB-QgCLo?si=UfhWdEJBSLxv8uqv). 
  (Port forwarding might be needed for your modem/router. Info in the tutorial video description)
